# Hello there!

It looks like you stumbled upon The Rule of Two (keywords) official repository! If you wish to raise an issue - go ahead! If you want to help and contribute - don't hesitate and reach out!

This is a fun little side-project. Being a big fan of Star Wars Legion and a very rusty Engineering Manager I decided to brush off some skills. To make things harder it's a Backend Developer's attempt on getting into some Frontend. 

## Project Setup

Typical NPM + Vue setup. 

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
